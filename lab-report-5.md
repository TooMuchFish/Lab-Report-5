# Choose TWO tests from the 652 tests in result.txt files
> By using the terminal in my VScode, I used the command "diff" to compare the results we get from running the "bash script.sh" on the both of those implement.
> By log in the ssh ieng6, we can access the remote account, and we can use the following command in it.

___
```
diff m3/results.txt markdown-parser/results.txt"
```

> I renamed my own implementation "markdown-parse" to "m3".
> And I cloned professor implementation "markdown-parse".
